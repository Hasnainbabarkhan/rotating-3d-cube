<h1>Welcome to My First Three.js App</h1>
  
  <p>This is a simple Three.js application that creates a rotating cube. It uses Vite for development and Three.js for 3D rendering.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Run the Project</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Clone it and Install Dependencies:</strong> Run the following command in your project directory:</li>
    </br>
    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
   
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Project Files</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>index.html</strong>: The basic HTML file to load the app.</li>
    <li><strong>main.js</strong>: The JavaScript file where the Three.js scene is created, including the rotating cube.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What You See</h2>
  <p>When you run the app, you'll see a rotating green cube in a 3D space. The cube spins slowly on both the X and Y axes.</p>
  
  <h2>Customizing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Change Cube Color:</strong> Modify the cube's material in <code>main.js</code> to change its color.</li>
    <li><strong>Cube Rotation:</strong> Change the values in the <code>animate()</code> function to control how the cube spins.</li>
  </ul>
